
README for perl module Devel::Fail::MakeTest

This module was created as a debugging aid for mechanized module
installers such as CPAN and CPANPLUS.

* `perl Makefile.PL` will run fine and create a good Makefile.

* `make` will succeed and print "`make all` was successful."

* `make test` will fail.  One test program, one test planned, one test failure.

* `make install` will succeed (without actually installing anything).
